# Work Day Planner

## Description

This calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm).  My hope is that this webpage allows people to stay organized with planning out their workday, and helps eliminate wasted time.  While working on this repo, I learned how to have users save data to local storage and how to use Third-Party APIs in JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When a user opens the work-day-planner, the current date and time is displayed in the header.  Each hour of the workday has a row with the following:
- Color coded: Grey for past hours, red for present hour, and green for future hours.
- Text input box
- Save button that saves input in the text box
When a user enters data in the text box, it will be saved in local storage for them to view later.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits

On 08/01/2023, I had a one hour tutoring session with Savien Love. She helped answer my questions on how to traverse the DOM and access data saved to local storage. The rest of the resources I used are listed below:
